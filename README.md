# Basic Blockchain Project

This project implements a basic blockchain in Python. It includes the core functionality of a blockchain, such as adding blocks, validating the chain, and retrieving chain data.

## Project Structure

```
basic-blockchain
├── src
│   ├── blockchain.py       # Main implementation of the blockchain
│   └── utils.py           # Utility functions for the blockchain
├── tests
│   └── test_blockchain.py  # Unit tests for the blockchain implementation
├── requirements.txt        # Project dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd basic-blockchain
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the blockchain implementation:
   You can run the `blockchain.py` file to see the blockchain in action.

## Usage

- The `Blockchain` class in `blockchain.py` allows you to create a new blockchain, add blocks, and validate the chain.
- Utility functions in `utils.py` assist with hashing and generating timestamps.

## Running Tests

To ensure everything is working correctly, run the unit tests located in the `tests` directory:
```
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
